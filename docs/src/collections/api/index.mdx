# litestore API (dev)

The litestore HTTP API _tries_ to be developer-friendly and simple, and it
heavily uses JSON for both the request and response.

**Note:** The API may be unconsistent at times and breaking changes may be
made until a stable release is made available

## Dog

The API response usually includes:

```json
{
	"status": 200,
	"message": "(optional message)",
	"dog": "https://http.dog/200"
}
```

The http.dog link is there for educational purposes (and it makes the API more fun âœ¨).
Credits goes to the original creator of the http.dog website.

## Errors

There are a few errors that are common among most routes.

### Data Validation

The API uses Zod to validate the requests' body and will return a response
similar to the following if the validation isn't passed:

```json
{
	"status": 400,
	"message": "Required fields not found within request body",
	"dog": "https://http.dog/400",
	"issues": [
		{
			"code": "invalid_type",
			"expected": "string",
			"received": "undefined",
			"path": ["path"],
			"message": "Required"
		}
	] /* type: ZodIssue[] */
}
```

### Internal Server Error

If HTTP code 500 (Internal Server Error) is returned, the possible causes may
include (but not limited to):

-   Errors while executing SQL statements (server code's fault/PostgreSQL connection configured incorrectly)
-   Errors while interacting with S3 (S3 connection configured incorrectly)

In any case, If you are interacting with a server you own and you encounter a
code 500 error, Check the server's log and the exception should be printed there.

If a request returns a HTTP code 500 and you have the need to display the reason
to the user, Please make sure that the response's body is valid JSON. If it
returns a response with HTML content, It is likely an unhandled exception.
Feel free to report any unhandled exceptions.
