# litestore API (dev)

The litestore HTTP API _tries_ to be developer-friendly and simple, and it
heavily uses JSON for both the request and response.

**Note:** The API may be unconsistent at times and breaking changes may be
made until a stable release is made available

## Dog

The API response usually includes:

```json
{
	"status": 200,
	"message": "(optional message)",
	"dog": "https://http.dog/200"
}
```

The http.dog link is there for educational purposes (and it makes the API more fun âœ¨).
Credits goes to the original creator of the http.dog website.

## CORS

If you send a HTTP request with the method `OPTIONS`, the server will assume that
you're sending a [CORS preflight request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request)
and will respond with the appropriate headers.

Specifically, The response will contain the following headers:

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Access-Control-Allow-Authorization: Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173
Allow: OPTIONS, GET, PATCH, DELETE
Content-Length: 0
Date: ...
```

Of course, The value of these headers will change depending on which route
you are sending the `OPTIONS` request to.

> **Note:** The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is configured within the
> server's `.env` file.

## Errors

There are a few errors that are common among most routes.

### Data Validation

The API uses Zod to validate the requests' body and will return a response
similar to the following if the validation isn't passed:

```json
{
	"status": 400,
	"message": "Required fields not found within request body",
	"dog": "https://http.dog/400",
	"issues": [
		{
			"code": "invalid_type",
			"expected": "string",
			"received": "undefined",
			"path": ["path"],
			"message": "Required"
		}
	] /* type: ZodIssue[] */
}
```

### Internal Server Error

If HTTP code 500 (Internal Server Error) is returned, the possible causes may
include (but not limited to):

-   Errors while executing SQL statements (server code's fault/PostgreSQL connection configured incorrectly)
-   Errors while interacting with S3 (S3 connection configured incorrectly)

In any case, If you are interacting with a server you own and you encounter a
code 500 error, Check the server's log and the exception should be printed there.

The error message returned by the API tries to be as descriptive and informative
about where the error happened as possible.
