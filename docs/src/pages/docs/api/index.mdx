# litestore API

The litestore HTTP API _tries_ to be developer-friendly and simple, and it
heavily uses JSON for both the request and response.

## Errors

The API uses Zod to validate the requests' body and will return a response
similar to the following if the validation isn't passed:

```json
{
	"status": 400,
	"message": "Required fields not found within request body",
	"dog": "https://http.dog/400",
	"issues": [
		{
			"code": "invalid_type",
			"expected": "string",
			"received": "undefined",
			"path": ["path"],
			"message": "Required"
		}
	] /* type: ZodIssue[] */
}
```

If a request returns a HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) code, if you have the need to display the reason,
Please make sure that the response's body is valid JSON. If it returns a response with HTML content, It is
likely an unhandled exception. Feel free to report any unhandled exceptions.
