# litestore docs

The litestore documentation is built with Astro (and Alpine.js)

The documentation is built with Astro's content collection features,
and the collections are in the `./src/collections/` folder. It will
contain two collections, which are `docs` (General documentation) and
`api` (HTTP API documentation)

The litestore docs uses the [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) font.
These files are from the Inter 4.1 (Nov 18, 2024) release:

-   `./src/styles/inter.css` (modified from original to point to correct path,
    and remove unused styles)
-   `./public/fonts/Inter*.woff2`
